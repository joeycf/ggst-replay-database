/**
 * Aggregate the parse substrate into the engine's KnownStats shape.
 *
 * ── THE STAT UNIT IS SIDE APPEARANCES (checklist step 8) ───────────────────
 * Strive is 1v1, so a side fields one character and a mirror match adds TWO to
 * that character's total — which is what the engine's "appearances" labels read
 * as, and what its own fixtures emit.
 *
 * The alternative unit — a per-record deduped union, "how many replays feature
 * this character" — is legitimate for a tag game on a shared roster, where both
 * sides routinely field the same fighter and double-counting a mirror would
 * mislead. It is the WRONG unit here, and this corpus makes the point loudly:
 * mirrors are not an edge case on Strive. The live recon's own 50-title samples
 * turned up Ramlethal vs Ramlethal, Johnny vs Johnny, Lucy vs Lucy and Ky vs Ky
 * inside a few hundred titles, because a 34-fighter roster with a strong meta
 * concentrates. A deduped union would silently under-count every one of them.
 * (The exact mirror count is a property of the corpus, so it is REPORTED by the
 * first parse into data/report.md rather than asserted here — an invented
 * number in a comment is worse than none.)
 *
 * ONE UNIT, EVERYWHERE. characterUsage, byPatchUsage and playerCharacters share
 * a denominator, so the usage bars, the per-patch timeline and the player
 * tables agree. Mixing them makes three panels disagree with no visible symptom,
 * which is the failure step 8 exists to prevent. emit.ts asserts the totals.
 *
 * NO pairingUsage. There is no same-side duo on a 1v1 game; emitting C(n,2)
 * over a counter-pick side would fabricate pairs that were never played.
 *
 * A NOTE ON THE X-AXIS, because Strive is the first game where it matters. The
 * byPatchUsage key order IS the meta chart's x-axis, and this game has 44
 * patches across five years — more columns than any sibling. The seeding below
 * (from the patch table, oldest → newest, rather than from record order) is
 * what keeps a patch with no replays holding its slot instead of the chart
 * silently re-ordering the day one arrives.
