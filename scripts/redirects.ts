/**
 * Player-page redirects — data/player-redirects.json, served from vercel.json.
 *
 * A player id is a slug of the handle, so a handle that changes spelling mints a
 * NEW page and abandons the old URL. That URL is prerendered, in the sitemap,
 * and possibly linked. This file maps a retired id to its current one, and
 * `npm run data:redirects` writes every row into vercel.json as a permanent
 * redirect — the same mechanism as Tekken and Tōkon, and the only redirect layer
 * on this platform.
 *
 * THIS HEADER USED TO SAY "the engine's 404 page and the static-artifacts module
 * read it". Neither does, and nothing else did: until 2026-09-28 this repo had
 * no vercel.json and no code anywhere served a row, so the first merge anyone
 * recorded here would have 404ed exactly as if it had never been written. The
 * ledger has always been empty, so nothing was lost, but the one comment that
 * said where a redirect goes pointed at a place that never read it.
 *
 * HAND-AUTHORED, DELIBERATELY. Merging two player ids is a claim that two
 * handles are the same PERSON, which no amount of string distance can establish
 * — "KULA" and "KULA2" may be one player or two, and guessing wrong merges two
 * people's records into one page. The pipeline reports candidates
 * (`npm run data:player-dupes` in the siblings); a human decides.
 *
 * THE CRON STILL REGENERATES vercel.json before its commit and then runs
 * `--drift`, which refuses the commit — holding the day's data — if a row cannot
 * ship. The ledger here does not drift; the corpus under it does. The cron
 * rewrites players.json nightly, so a destination can stop being a player, or a
 * retired source can come back as one, with nobody touching this file. A held
 * run must be a two-minute fix from the log alone, so every refusal names the
 * row and its fix.
 *
 * THE DESTINATION MUST BE RELATIVE. The shell rewrites /ggst/:path* to this
 * deployment (replay-database-shell/vercel.json), so an absolute Location would
 * send a visitor on replaydatabase.com to ggst-replay-database.vercel.app.
 *
 * Run: npm run data:redirects   write vercel.json from the ledger (the cron's
 *                               "Regenerate player redirects" step)
 *      --drift / --check        verify, never write: bad rows, lost rows,
 *                               vercel.json out of step with the ledger (the
 *                               cron's pre-commit "Refuse redirect drift" step,
 *                               and `npm run typecheck`)
